## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Wow, never expected someone to stalk my profile other than me. ðŸ˜‡

Well, you're here now so... this is me:

I hear to the name "Tobias" and spawned in 2006. The world of coding is new to me but I'm having a great time so far (help). My only project so far is a Discord bot for one of my communities. I'm owner of a german 10k+ community and started coding when our developer left our team.
